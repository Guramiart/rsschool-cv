## About me
I am interested in engineering and technology. Now I'm working as the head of the technical department in a telecommunications company in the Mogilev. 

I started learning programming with C++ and later switched to Java. I've been studying it for over a year. 

At the moment I want to get front-end development skills and become a full-stack developer in the future.
